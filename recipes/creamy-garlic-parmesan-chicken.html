    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This quick and tasty garlic and parmesan chicken is super easy to make.</p>
    <p>The chicken is first cooked in olive oil and seasoned with just salt and pepper. After the chicken is cooked through, we will make the sauce.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 small-medium chicken breasts or 2 large halved</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3-4 cloves garlic minced</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large heavy skillet or pan. Add chicken to the pan and cook for 5-6 minute per side or until the outside is golden and the chicken is cooked through (cooking times will vary depending on the thickness of the chicken breasts).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the pan, reduce heat to low-medium, and add garlic; stir for 30 seconds. Add the cream, Italian seasoning, and parmesan cheese. Stir to combine. Stir in 1 cup of chopped spinach if desired. Simmer for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
